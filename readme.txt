= The Form =

You can customize the form to your specific situation by adding or removing fields, or changing properties like the order, the text before or after, and the placeholder text.

The form also offers **anti-spam** options like honeypots and Captcha via these plugins: [Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/), [Really Simple Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/), and [Advanced noCaptcha reCaptcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-nocaptcha-recaptcha/).

Send a **notification email** to your multiple admins when new testimonials are submitted.

= Views =

A View is a simple, intuitive way to control the many available options.

For displaying testimonials:

* select which testimonials to show
* set the sort order
* select which fields to include
* extras like pagination
* style options
* slideshow settings if desired
* and more

For showing the form:

* select categories to assign the new testimonial to (optional)
* style options

Add the View's shortcode to a page or use the widget to add it to a sidebar.

= Style =

Strong Testimonials offers a handful of templates to try in your theme. The default template is just generic enough to look good in most cases with maybe a few tweaks.

Need help matching your theme? Got some weird spacing or floating? I'm here to help.

For ultimate control and seamless integration, any **template file and stylesheet** pair can be copied into your theme. (A tutorial and more templates coming soon.)

= Recommended =

* [Simple Colorbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-colorbox/) to open thumbnails into full-size images. Nice!
* [Simple Custom CSS](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/) is my go-to plugin for quick CSS fixes.
* [Wider Admin Menu](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wider-admin-menu/) lets your admin menu b r e a t h e.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the fields on the form? =

Yes. There is a custom field editor where you can add or remove fields, change field details, and drag-and-drop to reorder them. You can also customize the form error & success messages and the Submit button.

= I want to use categories. Can I add a category selector to the submission form? =

Yes. After setting up your categories, you can add a category dropdown element to the form.

= Can I edit the notification email that goes out when a new testimonial has been submitted? =

Yes. You can edit the subject line, the message, the sender, and the recipient(s). You can also turn it off altogether.

= Can I change which client fields appear below the testimonial? =

Yes. In Views, the client fields, including your custom fields, can be changed with a few clicks. The `[strong]` shortcode has child shortcodes `[client]` and `[field]`. Here's a good [example](http://demos.wpmission.com/strong-testimonials/the-strong-shortcode/custom-fields/).

= Can I change "testimonial" to "review", for example? =

Maybe. Instructions are [here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-change-the-slug). However, this does not seem to work for all theme/plugin combinations so I plan to build this into the plugin soon.

= My theme also includes testimonials. Will that be a problem? =

It depends. I have narrowed down the causes of many conflicts and addressed them in the plugin. If you encounter trouble, use the support form or contact me and we'll sort it out. If you want help disabling testimonials in your theme, even better :)

= I'm familiar with template files. Can I customize the template? =

Yes. You can copy a template to your theme, with or without its associated stylesheet, and customize it as you see fit. You can also have multiple custom templates. (A tutorial is coming soon.)

= Can I make some suggestions? =

I'm all ears! Many of the improvements over the last year are the result of feedback and ideas from people using the plugin in a variety of sites. Here are [some recent requests](https://www.wpmission.com/strong-testimonials/feature-requests/) awaiting your votes.

= Will it import my existing testimonials? =

Not yet.
