		<p>This may be a little different than others you've tried. There is only one shortcode and one widget.</p>

		<h2><?php _e( 'Views make it simpler', 'strong-testimonials' ); ?></h2>

		<p>First, create a <strong>view</strong> for anything you want to display. A view is simply of group of settings. You can create an unlimited number of views.</p>

		<p>For example, you might have one view to <strong>display a grid</strong> of your testimonials, another view for a testimonial <strong>submission form</strong>, and another view for a <strong>slideshow</strong>.</p>

		<p>Then add the view to your site using its unique shortcode or by selecting the view in the widget.</p>

		<h2><?php _e( 'What\'s new' ); ?></h2>

		<p><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span>Star ratings.</p>

		<p><span class="dashicons dashicons-admin-page"></span>Use standard WordPress pagination just like standard blog posts.</p>

		<p><span class="dashicons dashicons-edit"></span>A redesigned fields section in the view editor.</p>

		<p><span class="dashicons dashicons-editor-paste-text"></span>Display some text before a field; for example "Service" or "Rating".</p>

		<p><span class="dashicons dashicons-performance"></span>Improved compatibility and performance.</p>

		<h2><?php _e( 'Translation', 'strong-testimonials' ); ?></h2>

		<p><?php _e( 'Strong Testimonials is compatible with WPML and Polylang.', 'strong-testimonials' ); ?></p>

		<p><?php _e( 'In each plugin, domains are added to the <strong>String Translation</strong> screens. Those domains encompass the form fields, the form messages, the notification email, and the "Read more" link text in your views. They are updated automatically when your form fields or settings change.', 'strong-testimonials' ); ?></p>

		<h2><?php _e( 'Troubleshooting' ); ?></h2>

		<h3><?php _e( 'Try clearing your caches' ); ?></h3>

		<p>Why? CSS and JavaScript files change occasionally. The plugin tries to load the latest version of each file (i.e. bust the cache) but sometimes caches still need to be cleared. That includes caching and minifying plugins, server-side caching, and your individual browsers.</p>

		<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Make it a habit to clear your caches after updating any plugin with front-end output.</p>

		<h3><?php _e( 'Upgrading from version 1?' ); ?></h3>

		<p>The &#91;strong&#93;, &#91;wpmtst&#93; and &#91;read_more&#93; shortcodes and the original widget <span
				style="color: red;">were removed</span> in version 2.0. <a href="https://www.wpmission.com/strong-testimonials-version-2-coming-soon/" target="_blank">Here's why</a>. <em>I promise this is the last major change.</em> Everything now happens in <strong>views</strong>.</p>
